### Dockerizing the API

The provided Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml files define a Docker image for the weather data API and its dependencies. 

These files to build and run the API in a containerized environment.

#### Understanding the Data Ingestion Pipeline

The image depicts a Data Ingestion Pipeline (Cron Job) that integrates with various AWS services to collect, process, and store weather data. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

Event Bridge Cron Rule for Scheduling: Schedules the data ingestion process to run periodically (e.g., hourly, daily).

Amazon EventBridge: A serverless event bus that routes events to different AWS services based on rules.
AWS Lambda: A serverless compute service that executes code in response to events (e.g., triggered by the Cron rule).

Amazon S3 (Storage Layer): A scalable object storage service for storing raw weather data.

Amazon Glue: A serverless data preparation service that cleans, transforms, and joins datasets.

AWS Lambda (Compute Layer): Executes the weather data API logic in response to API requests.

Amazon RDS (Postgres): A managed relational database service for storing processed weather data.

AWS CloudWatch Logs: A service for collecting, aggregating, and analyzing log data from your AWS resources.

Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service): A pub/sub messaging service that can be used to send notifications about data ingestion completion or errors.



### API Deployment (Serverless/Containerization):

The API can be deployed as serverless functions using AWS Lambda or containerized using Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service).

#### Deploying on AWS

To deploy the API, database, and data ingestion pipeline on AWS, you can follow these steps:

#### AWS Services:

Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS): Containerize the API using Docker and deploy it to an ECS cluster for scalability and fault tolerance.

Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR): Store your container images securely in ECR for easy deployment to ECS.

Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS): Create a managed PostgreSQL database instance to store weather data.

AWS Lambda: Implement the data ingestion logic as a Lambda function triggered by a CloudWatch Events schedule.

Amazon API Gateway: Create an API Gateway endpoint to expose the weather data API publicly.

Amazon CloudWatch Logs: Monitor the logs from your API, database, and data ingestion Lambda function.
