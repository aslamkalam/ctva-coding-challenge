## Task Overview

This document describes the data model designed to represent weather data records using SQLAlchemy as the Object-Relational Mapper (ORM).

#### Project Context

This code pertains to the first task of a weather data analysis project. The overall project involves ingesting weather data, designing a database schema, performing data analysis, and creating a REST API to expose the data.



#### Future Considerations:

The data model can be expanded to accommodate additional weather data elements or integrate with other relevant entities.

Additional indexes or constraints might be necessary depending on future data analysis requirements.
